# SAP Datasphere Bikes Sales Sample Content
To explore SAP Datasphere, a "Bike Sales" sample content is offered. This sample content also comes with sample data.
The download contains a data model file for a SAP HANA 2.x to consume the sample data remotely from your SAP HANA. Or use CSV files in case you want to start without a SAP HANA.

# Requirements
To use the content, you need access to SAP Datasphere. Details can be found on our [website](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/datasphere.html) here.
If you want to use your SAP HANA as a remote source with the content, you need a SAP HANA 2.x release
Of course any HANA 1.x release or SAP HANA Cloud release can be used with SAP Datasphere, but the sample content can currently only be imported into SAP HANA 2.x.
A version for SAP HANA Cloud may be offered in the future.

# Download and Installation
Download the ZIP file (sapdatasphere_content.zip) from [release page](https://github.com/SAP-samples/datasphere-content/releases).
The ZIP file contains:
*	SAP HANA Import (sapdatasphere_content.tar.gz) 
*	CSV files (sapdatasphere_content_csv.zip)

To access the remote SAP HANA system from SAP Datasphere an additional configuration might be needed – depending on the current customer setup. Details can be found in the [SAP Help Documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_DATASPHERE).
